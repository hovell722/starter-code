# Vagrant 102 - Provisioning

:sunflower:

For a sunflower to grow, it requires water and soil.
Much like the sunflower, we create the universe with a virtual machine, but now we must provide the substance to life!

PROVISION!


In vagrant we must do the same and provide our universe (virtual machine) with file & folders.
We must also provide instructions on what to do with these folders, if so choose of course.
